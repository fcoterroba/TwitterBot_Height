# TwitterBot_Height
There's a twitterbot made in Python which upload a tweet once a day with the name of a famous person and her/his height (in foots and meters)

**REMEMBER:** You'll need an account with permissions on API Development Kit of Twitter.

## Automate
This script will tweet every time you run it.

But, that wouldn't really be a bot because depends of a human. Not cool.

I deployed the script over a VPS on Debian 10 and make a cronjob to run the script every day at 6 pm.

`00 18 * * * cd /path/to/the/where/are/the/script && /usr/bin/python3 main.py`
